,,,Indicator,Relevance,Relevant EU Targets or Actions,Latest figures,,,,,,,
Production and consumption,1,%),1. EU self-sufficiency for raw materials (%),"The circular economy should help to address the supply risks for raw materials, in particular critical raw materials.",None,N/A,,,,,,,
,2,,2. Green public procurement (GPP),Public procurement accounts for a large share of consumption and can drive the circular economy.,Only an indicative 50% GPP target (COM/2008/400),N/A,,,,,,,
,3a,,3a. Generation of municipal waste per capita (kg per capita),In a circular economy waste generation is minimised.,No targets but Member State’s waste prevention programmes are encouraged to include measures in this regard,492 kg/capita (2018),,,,,,,
,3b,,3b. Generation of waste excluding major mineral wastes per GDP (unit),,No targets but Member State’s waste prevention programmes are encouraged to include measures in this regard,66 kg per thousand euros (2018),,,,,,,
,3c,,3c. Generation of waste excluding mineral wastes per domestic material consumption (%),,No targets but Member State’s waste prevention programmes are encouraged to include measures in this regard,12,,8% (2018),,,,,
Waste management,5a,,5a. Recycling rate municipal waste (%),Increasing recycling is part of the transition to a circular economy.,Recycling targets and measures set in Directive (EU) 2018/851 (see table 5),47,,5% (2016),,,,,
,5b,,5b. Recycling rate excluding major mineral waste (%),This reflects the progress in recycling key waste streams.,No explicit targets or actions.,56% (2016),,,,,,,

Secondary raw materials,7a,,7a. End of life recycling input rates (EOL-RIR) (%),"In a circular economy, secondary raw materials are commonly used to make new products.",No targets but member states are encouraged to develop measures to increase the share of secondary materials in total material demand,N/A,,,,,,,

,8,,8. Trade in recyclable raw materials,Trade in recyclables reflects the importance of the internal market and global participation in the circular economy.,No targets, limited strengthening of export requirements outside the EU (Directive (EU) 2018/851) and facilitation of trade of fertilizers within EU (Regulation 2019/1009),,Imports from non-EU countries: 8,9 million tonnes (2019), Exports to non-EU countries: 2,5 million tonnes (2019), Intra EU trade: 4,"9 million tonnes (2019)"""

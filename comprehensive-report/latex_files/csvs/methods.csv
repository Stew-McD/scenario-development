Gausemeier approach;Scenario development method involving the identification of future developments, evaluation of influencing factors, and determination of desired and undesired developments;Systematic analysis of future developments and factors;Relies on expert judgment and subjective assessments;Strategic planning, Innovation management
Schwartz' 8-Step Scenario Model;Scenario building model consisting of eight steps: identify the focal issue, determine the key forces, construct the scenario framework, identify driving forces, assess the uncertainties, develop the scenarios, analyze the scenarios, and monitor and adjust the scenarios;Systematic progression through stages of scenario development;Requires detailed data and analysis;Strategic planning, Decision-making
Schoemaker's 10-Step Scenario Model;Scenario building model consisting of ten steps: identify the focal issue, determine the scope, identify the key driving forces, develop the scenarios, define the scenario logic, assess the scenarios, refine the scenarios, examine implications, formulate actions, and communicate results;Emphasis on thorough analysis and evaluation of scenarios;Can be time-consuming and resource-intensive;Strategic planning, Risk management

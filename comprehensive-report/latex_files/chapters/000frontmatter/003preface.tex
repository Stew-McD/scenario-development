The \href{https://www.futuram.eu/}{FutuRaM project} aims to quantify the current and future availability of secondary raw materials (SRM), focusing on critical raw materials (CRMs)~\cite{graedel2015materials}. This study is concerned with six waste streams in the EU member states, as well as Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (EU27+4). In this report, the EU27+4 will henceforth be referred to as the EU, unless specified otherwise.

Work package two (WP2) is conducting foresight studies for materials that are either classified as critical to the EU economy or are significant due to factors such as their large volumes, commercial importance, and environmental impacts~\cite{eu2023crmact,eu2023crmstudy,eu2023crmqna,graedel2015materials}. WP2 is tasked with developing a set of coherent scenarios for material use and waste/recovery over time across various sectors in the EU. This report describes the three distinct scenarios and the process by which they were developed.

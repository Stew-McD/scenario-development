# Introduction

## Scenarios in foresight studies
Scenarios are a powerful tool in foresight studies, providing a structured way to explore and understand potential future developments and their implications~\cite{van2012scenarios, wright2013


## The FutuRaM project and its scope

The \href{https://www.futuram.eu/}{FutuRaM project} aims to quantify the current and future availability of secondary raw materials (SRM), focusing on critical raw materials (CRMs)~\cite{graedel2015materials}. This study is concerned with six waste streams in the EU member states, as well as Iceland, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom (EU27+4). In this report, the EU27+4 will henceforth be referred to as the EU, unless specified otherwise.

Work package two (WP2) is conducting foresight studies for materials that are either classified as critical to the EU economy or are significant due to factors such as their large volumes, commercial importance, and environmental impacts~\cite{eu2023crmact,eu2023crmstudy,eu2023crmqna,graedel2015materials}. WP2 is tasked with developing a set of coherent scenarios for material use and waste/recovery over time across various sectors in the EU. This report describes the three distinct scenarios and the process by which they were developed.

In the next phases of scenario development, future product composition and recovery technology will be assessed, scenario elements will be quantified, and all data will be integrated with the quantitative models for waste generation and SRM recovery.

The FutuRaM project aims to offer a nuanced understanding of the potential future waste management and resource recovery landscape within the EU. This approach provides insights into key drivers, uncertainties, and the possible impacts of policy and technological advancements. Additionally, by aligning SRM recovery efforts with the United Nations Framework Classification for Resources (UNFC)~\cite{unfc2023}, the project aims to facilitate the commercial exploitation of SRMs and CRMs by manufacturers, recyclers, and investors. With the comprehensive knowledge base that we are developing, FutuRaM aims to support informed decision-making by policymakers and government, as well as industry and community stakeholders.

## FutuRaM's scenarios
The three scenarios that have been developed in FutuRaM are:  Business as usual (BAU), Recovery (REC), and Circularity (CIR). These scenarios are designed to be internally consistent and provide an overview of the potential future landscape of waste management and SRM recovery within the EU. The scenarios are not predictions but rather narratives that explore different possible futures based on current trends, technological advancements, and policy developments. These qualitative narratives can serve as a foundation for quantitative scenarios for use in modelling such as life cycle assessment (LCA) and material flow analysis (MFA)~\cite{fava1991life, baumann2004practical, hellweg2014life, brunner2018material}.


1. Business as usual (BAU)
    The BAU scenario extrapolates current trends into the future with limited change. Using forecasting techniques, it projects a potential future where there are minor advancements in resource efficiency, recovery technology, and the energy transition, but primary extraction of raw materials remains the dominant practice.

2. Recovery (REC)
    The Recovery scenario imagines a future leveraging advanced technology to significantly enhance SRM recovery from waste streams. It outlines a future where the EU successfully meets its recycling and recovery targets through an effective waste management system and circular design principles~\cite{halleux2021batt,helander2023battelv}. This scenario sees an increased recovery rate of SRMs, extensive use of digitalisation and automation in recycling processes, and new or strengthened waste regulations in line with EU targets.

3. Circularity (CIR)
    The Circularity scenario captures the ideal of a fully realised circular economy, going beyond end-of-life recovery to minimise waste at every production and consumption stage. It predicts a future where the EU's targets for recycling, recovery, and circularity are met through extensive stakeholder collaboration, new business models, and increased use of renewable energy and circular economy technologies~\cite{eu2020circ,kirchherr2017circ, domenech2019transition}.

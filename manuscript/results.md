## Scenario storylines

1. Business as usual (BAU)
    This scenario envisions the future based on the current situation, extending to 2050 with minimal deviation from present consumption patterns and without substantial development of the secondary raw material (SRM) recovery system. While there may be advances in areas such as resource efficiency, recovery technology, and the energy transition, significant changes are hindered by economic, social, and political constraints. The extraction of primary raw materials continues to be the predominant source used to satisfy the EU's growing SRM demand.

    This scenario envisions the future based on the current situation, extending to 2050 with very little deviation from present consumption patterns and the secondary raw material (SRM) system~\cite{iea2022worldenergyoutlook}. While there may be advances in some areas such as resource efficiency, recovery technology, and the energy transition, substantial modifications remain hindered by economic, social, and political constraints. The primary extraction of raw materials continues to be the primary source to meet the EU's demand.

    In the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario, we are projecting the trajectory of the present into the future, extending up to the mid-century mark, 2050, with minimal disruption to existing consumption habits and the secondary raw material (SRM) system. This scenario unfolds on the assumption that the current pace and direction of technological, economic, and social development continue unhindered, and is characterised by a strong persistence of today's patterns.

    In this scenario, we see moderate improvements in resource efficiency, advancements in recovery technology, and a slow transition towards greener energy sources. However, these developments are only minor tweaks to the existing system, failing to disrupt or fundamentally alter the established structure. The potential for transformational change remains largely untapped due to various hurdles. Economic constraints, social resistance to change, political inertia, and entrenched interests act as barriers to change, stifling efforts toward a more sustainable SRM system.

    Primary extraction of raw materials remains the dominant source for raw materials consumed in the EU, continuing the linear `take-make-dispose' model of resource consumption (see \autoref{fig:linearmodel}). Base metals are well recycled, given their developed markets and economies of scale but rare/special metals are wasted because recycling technologies and economics do not allow for their recovery. Recycling and recovery rates remain stubbornly low, resulting in significant CRM waste. Meanwhile, material demand continues to rise in tandem with GDP growth, further exacerbating the resource pressure.

    \begin{itemize}
  \item A forecasting model is used to predict the future based on the current situation and the development of existing trends.
  \item Many EU targets for recycling and recovery are not met, and the current linear model largely persists.
  \item Material demand keeps pace with GDP growth, perpetuating a trend of increasing consumption. Primary mining and extraction persist as the leading sources of raw materials, underlining the dependency on traditional extraction methods.
  \item Recycling and recovery rates continue to lag, leading to an accumulation of SRM waste that signals missed opportunities for resource reuse.
  \item The environmental repercussions of mining and extraction, such as land degradation and water pollution, continue to be a pressing concern, reflecting the ecological toll of this linear model.
  \item The EU's dependency on imports of SRMs escalates, heightening the risk of supply disruptions. While supply disruption can serve to stimulate investment in new SRM recovery, volatility stifles innovation and advancements in this field.
  \item The industrial focus remains on cost-effective material production and use, disregarding the long-term sustainability aspect.
\end{itemize}

    **Key characteristics of the Business as usual (linear economy) scenario:**

    - A forecasting model is used to predict the future based on the current situation and the development of existing trends.
    - EU targets, including those for eco-design, recycling, and recovery, are not met, and the current linear model largely persists.
    - Material demand remains coupled with economic growth, perpetuating a trend of increasing consumption.
    - Primary mining and extraction persist as the leading sources of raw materials, underlining the dependency on traditional extraction methods.
    - Recycling and recovery rates continue to lag, leading to increased production of SRM-containing waste and missed opportunities for resource reuse.
    - The EU's dependency on imports of SRMs escalates, heightening the risk of supply disruptions~\cite{iea2023crm}.
    - Investment in new SRM recovery technologies remains minimal, stifling innovation and advancements in this field.
    - The industrial focus remains on cost-effective material production and use, disregarding long-term sustainability.
    - Material scarcity and price fluctuations pose potential risks to EU industry, highlighting the vulnerability of this business model~\cite{mancini2013supplysecurity}.
    - Without significant updates to environmental regulations, negative impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity intensify.
    - Mining activity in the EU remains limited and concentrated in only a few member states. Current exploration projects (e.g., for Lithium in PT, FR, UK and rare earths in SE) are not realised.
    - The transitions to renewable energy and e-mobility continue at their current pace.

2. Recovery (REC)
    The Recovery scenario imagines a future leveraging advanced technology to significantly enhance SRM recovery from waste streams. It outlines a future where the EU successfully meets its recycling and recovery targets through an effective waste management system and circular design principles~\cite{halleux2021batt,helander2023battelv}. This scenario sees an increased recovery rate of SRMs, extensive use of digitalisation and automation in recycling processes, and new or strengthened waste regulations in line with EU targets.

    In the recovery scenario, the central emphasis is on harnessing sophisticated technologies to salvage SRMs from waste streams at the end of their lifecycle. While there are noticeable strides towards the incorporation of `circular design' principles and re-X strategies (which focus on reducing, reusing, recycling, repairing, and refurbishing), material demand increases similarly to the BAU scenario. This is, however, mitigated to some extent by the implementation of a comprehensive material recovery system.

    **Key features of this technology-promoted recovery scenario include:**

    - This scenario uses a combination of forecasting and backcasting methods to envision the future.
    - The backcasting method is applied to scenario factors covered by governmental targets, starting with the desired outcome and working backwards to the present.
    - The forecasting method is used for scenario factors not covered by governmental targets, projecting from the current situation into the future.
    - EU targets for recycling and recovery are met, as the waste management system becomes more expansive, efficient, and effective.
    - Technological innovation drives increased recovery rates of SRMs, enabling more efficient use of waste.
    - Digitalisation and automation are extensively used in recycling processes, enhancing productivity and efficiency.
    - Business models such as leasing and take-back schemes emerge, shifting traditional consumption patterns (with a focus on take-back for recycling).
    - Ecodesign mandates are implemented, particularly focusing on end-of-life recovery.
    - There is greater exploration and exploitation of alternative sources such as urban mining, waste streams, and tailings, presenting new opportunities for resource acquisition.
    - New waste regulations and guidelines for SRM recovery are introduced, enforcing better management and extraction of SRMs.
    - Investment in research and development for SRM recovery technologies increases, promoting continuous innovation.
    - Closer collaboration and information sharing between industry and government institutions (e.g., waste tracking and digital product passports) streamline processes and expedite decision-making.
    - New jobs are created in the recycling and recovery sector, offering economic benefits and improving employment rates.
    - SRM production and use become more efficient and cost-effective, supporting economic sustainability.

3. Circularity (CIR)
    The Circularity scenario captures the ideal of a fully realised circular economy, going beyond end-of-life recovery to minimise waste at every production and consumption stage. It predicts a future where the EU's targets for recycling, recovery, and circularity are met through extensive stakeholder collaboration, new business models, and increased use of renewable energy and circular economy technologies~\cite{eu2020circ,kirchherr2017circ, domenech2019transition}.

    In this scenario, we move in the direction of the maximum achievable state of material efficiency as government policy, private innovation and social changes are rapidly driving the transition toward a circular economy. The emphasis here rests heavily on re-X strategies that are implemented in the design phase of products (e.g., repairability and re-manufacturability) and that are actualised by changes in consumer behaviour (e.g reduction, refusal, engagement in the `sharing economy' and curtailment of the `throw-away' mindset). 

    Further, being enabled by the widespread adoption of `circular design' principles and improvements in information transparency (e.g., waste tracking and digital product passports) the system for the treatment of post-consumer waste can divert a significant amount of their inflows (to, for example, re-use and re-manufacture) with the residual fraction being readily segregated into purer, more efficiently recoverable, material streams. 

    This scenario envisions a future where government policies are in synergy with private sector innovation and societal changes, driving a wholesale transition towards a circular economy. Unlike the recovery scenario, where the focus is on the end-of-life recovery of materials, this scenario emphasises minimising waste at all stages, starting from the design phase itself.

    **Key characteristics of the Circularity scenario:**

    - EU targets for recycling, recovery, and circularity are met, driven by advances in waste management, ecodesign, and re-X strategies.
    - A circular economy is implemented, prioritising waste reduction, resource efficiency, and a shift away from the "take-make-dispose" model.
    - SRM recycling and recovery rates increase significantly, indicating more efficient resource use.
    - Greater emphasis is placed on designing products for reuse and recycling, turning waste into a valuable resource.
    - There is more extensive use of renewable energy and clean technologies in SRM production and use, supporting a low-carbon economy.
    - Collaboration between stakeholders—including industry, government, and consumers—improves, enhancing the implementation of circular practices.

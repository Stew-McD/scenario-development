# Abstract

This report presents the first phase of the scenario development process â€” the storyline narrative phase. Three distinct future scenarios have been drafted up to the year 2050: Business as Usual, Recovery, and Circularity. These scenarios are designed to be internally consistent and provide an overview of the potential future landscape of waste management and SRM recovery within the EU.

The scenario development process employs a methodology that integrates both forecasting and backcasting techniques to build a comprehensive, future-facing knowledge base that can aid fact-based decision-making~\cite{dreborg1996essence, boerjeson2005scenariosreport, boerjeson2005scenariosarticle, amer2013, sardesai2021, lloyd2014objectivity, ardente2014}. 

In the next phases of scenario development, future product composition and recovery technology will be assessed, scenario elements will be quantified, and all data will be integrated with the quantitative models for waste generation and SRM recovery.

The FutuRaM project aims to offer a nuanced understanding of the potential future waste management and resource recovery landscape within the EU. This approach provides insights into key drivers, uncertainties, and the possible impacts of policy and technological advancements. Additionally, by aligning SRM recovery efforts with the United Nations Framework Classification for Resources (UNFC)~\cite{unfc2023}, the project aims to facilitate the commercial exploitation of SRMs and CRMs by manufacturers, recyclers, and investors. With the comprehensive knowledge base that we are developing, FutuRaM aims to support informed decision-making by policymakers and government, as well as industry and community stakeholders.

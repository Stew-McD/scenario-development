## 3.2 Scenario narratives

### 3.2.1 Business-as-usual

#### Storyline narrative

This scenario envisions the future based on the current situation, extending to 2050 with very little deviation from present consumption patterns and the secondary raw material (SRM) system (Simon, 1998). While there may be advances in some areas such as resource efficiency, recovery technology, and the energy transition, substantial modifications remain hindered by economic, social, and political constraints. The primary extraction of raw materials continues to be the main source to meet the EU's demand.

In the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario, we are projecting the trajectory of the present into the future, extending up to 2050, with minimal disruption to existing consumption habits and the SRM system. This scenario assumes the current pace and direction of technological, economic, and social development continue unhindered, characterized by a strong persistence of today's patterns.

We see moderate improvements in resource efficiency, advancements in recovery technology, and a slow transition towards greener energy sources. However, these are only minor tweaks to the existing system, failing to disrupt or fundamentally alter the established structure. The potential for transformational change remains largely untapped due to various hurdles: economic constraints, social resistance to change, political inertia, and entrenched interests.

Primary extraction of raw materials remains the dominant source for raw materials consumed in the EU, continuing the linear "take-make-dispose" model of resource consumption (see Figure 1; Netherlands Circular Economy Plan, 2016). Base metals are well recycled, but rare/special metals are wasted because recycling technologies and economics do not allow for their recovery. Recycling and recovery rates remain stubbornly low, resulting in significant CRM waste. Meanwhile, material demand continues to rise in tandem with GDP growth, further exacerbating resource pressure.

*Figure 1. The linear economy model in the business-as-usual scenario (Netherlands Circular Economy Plan, 2016)*

Moreover, the environmental impacts of mining and extraction persist as a significant concern. These operations continue to degrade ecosystems, leading to loss of biodiversity and contributing to climate change (IPCC, 2024). Simultaneously, the EU becomes increasingly dependent on imports of SRMs, raising concerns about supply chain security and geopolitical risks.

Innovation in SRM recovery technologies is hampered by a lack of investment and regulatory support. The focus remains predominantly on cost-effective material production and use, with little regard for environmental implications or long-term sustainability. Material scarcity and price fluctuations may become a considerable risk to the EU industry, limiting stable penetration of new recovery technology and threatening economic stability.

The tightening of environmental regulations is restricted, inadequately addressing emerging challenges or incentivising sustainable practices. The lack of regulatory progress may further exacerbate environmental damage and biodiversity loss.

In essence, the BAU scenario is characterised by a continuation of current trends and practices, a future where the potential for a sustainable SRM system is unrealised due to the stranglehold of prevailing economic, social, and political constraints.

**Key characteristics of the Business-as-usual (linear economy) scenario:**

- A forecasting model is used to predict the future based on the current situation and the development of existing trends.
- Many EU targets for recycling and recovery are not met, and the current linear model largely persists.
- Material demand keeps pace with GDP growth, perpetuating a trend of increasing consumption. Primary mining and extraction persist as the leading sources of raw materials, underlining the dependency on traditional extraction methods.
- Recycling and recovery rates continue to lag, leading to an accumulation of SRM waste that signals missed opportunities for resource reuse.
- The environmental repercussions of mining and extraction, such as land degradation and water pollution, continue to be a pressing concern.
- The EU's dependency on imports of SRMs escalates, heightening the risk of supply disruptions. While supply disruption can stimulate investment in new SRM recovery, volatility stifles innovation and advancements in this field.
- The industrial focus remains on cost-effective material production and use, disregarding the long-term sustainability aspect.
  
#### Waste stream specific scenario impacts

##### Batteries

In the BAU scenario, the management of end-of-life batteries remains largely unchanged. The lack of technological innovation and regulatory incentives leads to continued low recovery rates of valuable materials from battery waste.

- Growing volume of battery waste due to increased use of electronic transport and renewable energy storage systems.
- Lack of technological innovation and regulatory incentives lead to low recovery rates for certain battery types and elements.
- Collection systems for battery waste remain sporadic and unstandardised.
- Primary extraction remains the dominant source of battery materials.
- Share of LIB will increase (EV, LMT, Industrial LIB uptake).
- LIB Battery Chemistries will change and new LIB technologies will enter the market, though not with a focus on recycling and recovery.
- Larger portable batteries: shift towards Li-ion batteries.
- Small format batteries in EEE: no significant change in battery chemistry.
- Use of critical resources continues but is already decreasing (BATT chemistry already changing towards less CRM content).
- Large-scale reuse of batteries is minimal.
- Collection rates do not fulfil the EU targets.
- Recycling efficiencies do not fulfil the EU targets.
- Recovery rates do not fulfil the EU targets.

##### End-of-Life Vehicles (ELV)

The BAU scenario maintains the current approach to end-of-life vehicles, with minimal improvements in the recovery and recycling process. The absence of effective technologies and regulatory incentives results in low recovery rates of valuable materials from ELVs.

- Legislation banning new ICEVs from 2035.
- Current recovery technologies are unable to significantly improve the extraction of valuable materials from ELVs.
- Consumer demand continues to drive high production of new vehicles.
- ELV collection systems remain at their current efficiency.
- A significant proportion of vehicle components continue to end up as waste.
- Gradual and slow improvement of recycling chain technology efficiency.
- No new legislation to improve recovery and support circular strategies in comparison to 2023.

##### Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE)

In the BAU scenario, the treatment of WEEE does not significantly change. The lack of technological progress and effective regulation results in low recovery rates of valuable materials from WEEE.

- Limited improvements in the recovery of valuable materials from WEEE.
- High consumer demand for new electronics continues to drive high WEEE generation.
- Ineffective collection systems and lack of public interest result in significant amounts of WEEE ending up in landfills.
- No significant growth in collaboration between government and industry for WEEE recovery.
- The majority of WEEE continues to be treated with common domestic waste, with low recycling rates.
- No groundbreaking technologies and practices to improve recovery and circularity.
- Reuse of products and components is not widely utilised.
- Changes in legislation (e.g., circular economy and product design targets, targets for collection and recycling) are not strictly implemented.
- The BAU and the REC scenarios are similar from the put-on-market perspective (e.g., production and consumption remain the same), but it’s the recovery stage that makes the difference.

##### Mining Waste

The BAU scenario sees the continuation of current practices in mining waste management. The absence of advanced recovery technologies and regulatory incentives leads to low recovery rates of valuable materials from mining waste.

- Limited technological advancements lead to static recovery rates of valuable materials from mining waste.
- Continued reliance on primary extraction as the dominant source of raw materials.
- Minimal advances in collaboration between government and industry for mining waste recovery.
- Low levels of traceability and management of mining waste.
- Mining waste remains a significant environmental challenge.
- Mining waste recovery projects remain too expensive.
- Little incentive for the private sector and public sector, except for monitoring environmental risks of existing deposits.

##### Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW)

In the BAU scenario, the management of Construction and Demolition Waste (CDW) remains largely unchanged.

- Focus on new construction to meet demand, no changes in CDW generation rate.
- No increase or refurbishment or renovation activities relative to new construction rates.
- Continue meeting the 2020 EU target from the Waste Directive (EU, 2008) of 70% CDW recovery (including preparation for re-use, recycling, and other material recovery, including backfilling).
- Recovery of metals remains on already high levels (>90%) (Moschen, 2023).
- Recovery of minerals remains on already high levels (>70%) by using them as aggregates in road construction and backfilling (Moschen, 2023).
- Recycling of wind turbines stays around 85% (mainly metals), permanent magnets continue to be recycled as part of the metal fractions.
- Base metals are recovered as they have been, though there are limited improvements in recovery technologies and regulatory incentives.
- Repowering trends for wind turbines persist.
- Excluding wind turbines, there is no particular focus on the recovery of CRMs from CDW, where they constitute only a small fraction of the total mass (e.g., embedded in scrap steel).

##### SLASH (Slags and Ashes)

In the BAU scenario, SLASH continues to be treated generally as low or negative-value waste. The absence of economically profitable recovery technologies or regulatory mandates leads to low improvements in the recovery rates of CRMs from SLASH.

###### Slags

Slags are waste products from the metallurgical industry and contain mainly minerals with some metals that could not be recovered during the metallurgical process. The reasons the metals are not recovered are:

1. Current technology does not allow further recovery.
2. The metals are not of economic interest.

More than 90% of the slags are minerals, therefore the slags that are in line with the environmental criteria (end of waste criteria) are valorised as aggregates for the construction industry or as SCM (cement replacement materials). Slags containing high concentrations of heavy metals are landfilled.

- The volume of slags will stay stable. From 2013–2023, there was a stable production of metals, which results in a stable production of slags.
- Due to the energy transition, it is expected the volume of slags from "classic" furnaces (e.g., BOF) will reduce and the number of slags from electric arc furnace will go up.
- There are limited facilities to recover CRMs/SRMs, but the metallurgical companies do their best to recover as much of the metals as per their economic interests.

###### Ashes

Ashes are the waste products from the incineration of fossil fuels, biomass, or waste. Two main types: fly ashes and bottom ashes. Coal fly ashes are used as SCM to replace cement up to 30%. Biomass (bottom and fly) ashes are used (based on the composition) as fertilizer or landfilled. Fly ashes from waste incineration are landfilled, while the bottom ashes are — depending on the location in the EU — further treated.

- In the last 10–20 years in some EU countries, there has been a shift from landfilling towards incineration, leading to an increase in the volume of ashes from waste incineration.
- Drop in the use of coal as a fuel source, so the volume of coal ashes dropped over the last 10 years and is expected to drop further.
- The volume of biomass incineration went up. It is uncertain if this volume will increase further due to land pressure.
- Almost all coal fly ashes are used as SCM (high-value stream up to 80 EUR/ton).
- For Biomass fly ashes there are no sorting facilities, while for waste incineration bottom ashes, there are sorting installations in place, but not present in all EU countries, so there is still room for improvement.

### 3.2.2 Recovery (REC)

#### Storyline narrative

In the recovery scenario, the focus is on leveraging advanced technologies to recover secondary raw materials (SRMs) from waste streams at the end of their lifecycle. While there is some movement towards circular design and re-X strategies, these are mostly implemented at the end-of-life stage, and overall material demand remains similar to the BAU scenario. However, this is offset by the introduction of a comprehensive material recovery system. Figure 2 illustrates the dominant material flow paths in the recovery scenario.

![The reuse economy model in the recovery scenario](120storylines/nl2016ce-reuse.png)
*Figure 2. The reuse economy model in the recovery scenario [4]*

The waste treatment sector is central in this scenario, with a strong emphasis on enhancing recovery technology. The adoption of cutting-edge technologies—such as artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and advanced robotics—transforms waste sorting, improves the quality of recovered materials, and increases the overall efficiency of recovery processes.

Policy development and standardisation are key, supporting EU-wide integration and compliance. Governments and policymakers play a crucial role by setting ambitious recovery targets, developing regulatory frameworks, and enforcing compliance. This approach also involves strengthening cross-border cooperation, harmonising waste management standards, and promoting knowledge and technology transfer among EU member states.

Achieving more ambitious environmental impact reduction targets requires significant progress in both technology and policy. Enhanced technological capabilities improve recovery rates, while robust policy measures ensure these advancements are widely adopted. The success of this scenario depends on the integration of advanced technology, regulatory harmonisation, and a commitment to continuous improvement in waste management and SRM recovery.

**Key characteristics of the technology-driven recovery scenario:**

- Combines forecasting and backcasting methods to envision the future.
- Backcasting is used for scenario factors covered by governmental targets, starting from the desired outcome.
- Forecasting is used for factors not covered by governmental targets, projecting from the current situation.
- EU targets for recycling and recovery are met, with a more expansive, efficient, and effective waste management system.
- Technological innovation drives increased SRM recovery rates and more efficient use of waste.
- Digitalisation and automation are widely used in recycling, improving productivity and accuracy.
- Alternative sources such as urban mining, waste streams, and tailings are explored for resource acquisition.
- New waste regulations and guidelines for SRM recovery are implemented.
- Investment in R&D for SRM recovery technologies increases, promoting continuous innovation.
- Closer collaboration and information sharing between industry and government streamline processes.
- New jobs are created in recycling and recovery, supporting economic growth.
- SRM production and use become more efficient and cost-effective.
- Environmental impacts from mining and extraction are reduced.
- The EU's dependence on primary extraction decreases, with SRM recovery becoming a more significant source of raw materials.
